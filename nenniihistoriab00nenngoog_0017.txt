agreeS, for the most part, with that which we
have already mentioned, omitting, however, the
date when the work was written. Hence, then,
it appears that there is the authority of only one
ancient manuscript for asserting that Nennius,
’ assuming him to be the author, composed his work
in the year 8583 and that itis ascribed to him
upon the saith of Prologues, of which no copies

Thffissuss ᾗ 3. In regard to the Prologue, it may further
idatio-⁰¹ be remarked that it speaks of the year 858 as
‘⁰¹⁹' being the same with the twenty-fourth year of
the reign of Mervin, king of the Britons (3, 17),
dates in the accuracy of whose concurrence a con· r
temporary writer could with difficulty commit an
error. In -the body of the work, however, we
find a contradictory statement. Itis there as·

less than thirty-eight years in the year of our
Lord which they connect with the regnal year of
the sovereign who was upon the throne when the

moreover show, that, if both be genuine, the body
of the work must have been written twenty years
before the Prologue.

and in mn. 904 it is stated that king Meruin,

the son of Rodri, was slain by the Saxons. The
