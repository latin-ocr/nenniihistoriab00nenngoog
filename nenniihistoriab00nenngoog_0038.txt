L 2. A second copy os Nennius, contained
in the manuscript last described. It omits the
Prologues, and the chapter about Ida king of
Northumbria, and has the title, ‘Gesta Brit-
tonum a Gilda Sapiente composita.' It states
that 796 years had elapsed from the periodos
our Lord's passion.

M. A manuscriptos the seventeenth een-
tury, formerly belonging to Dr. Hunter the
celebrated anatomist, and now, along with the
rest os his collections, the property of the Uni-
versity of Glasgow. It appears to be a tran-
soript of the Cambridge manuscript marked L,
containing, like it, the two Prologues, and the
interpolated passages.² It must be admitted,
however, that it ·fumishes a reading in the
second Prologue which is peculiar to itself, ’
and thus restores sense to a passage which is
unintelligible in all other copies³ ’
