XX PREFACE·

as if for publication, no edition appeared until the
year 1691, when Gale inserted it in his Collection
of the early English Historians.¹ In its prepara-
tion he adopted as the basis of his text the manu-
script belonging to the Public Library of Cam-
bridge, which has so frequently been mentioned
as containing both the PrologucS‚ as well as much
interpolated matter. We are not informed of the
reasons which induced him to give the preference
to this copy, when he had access to others of
greater antiquity; we may therefore presume
that he adopted it as containing additional mat-
ter which be did not find elsewhere. The notes
which he appended contain the Various Readings
which he obtained from otber manuscripts, chiefly
those m the Cottonian Library.

ther, of interpolated passages that text hasbeen
adopted which is least vitiated by such extra-

neous matter.³ The errors into which its tran-
