L. A manuscript of the end ol the twelsth,
or beginning of the thirteenth century, now in
the Public Library of the University of Cam·
bridge, marked F. f. i. 27. Itis a handsome vo·
lume, written in double columns, upon vellum,
appears once to have belonged to the monks of
Barbam, (see this Introduction, ς 15, note ¹,)
and is the only ancient copy which contains
both Prologues. It formed, as has already .
been remarked, the basis of Gale's text3 and
is the only copy which prefixes to the history
a series of Capitula, which contain internal
evidence either of forgery or interpolation.
These have in this edition been thrown into
an Appendix. This manuscript also contains
the following verses, which may perhaps be
worth preserving, as well as two extracts
from some short chronological memoranda.

Versus¹ Nennini ad Samuelem filium ma-

gistri sui, Beulani presbyteri, viri religi-
osi, ad quem Historiam istam scripserat.

¹1t willbeobserved that each order, excepting the letters X,

word of these verses commences Y, and Z, which commence
with a letter in alphabetical lines.
