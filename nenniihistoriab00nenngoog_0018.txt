former of these individuale is necessarily ex-

ing that it is the latter to whom allusion is made
in tho Prologue, it will follow that he must have
reigned seventy years, that Prologue showing
that he ascended the throne'in 111. 834. But, A
assuming that tho authority of the Prologue
should here be rejected, and that of the text
received, which shows that Meruin came to the
throne in 1111. 876, we reduce the whole calcula·

thought pervadas each, the expressions are near-

and the reasons which the author assigns for
writing are the same in both instances It is
obvious, then, that one cannot be considered as
a supplement to the other. If both be authentic,
we must assume that Nennius, being dissatisfied
with one of these Prologues, intended that it
should be superseded by the other3 but that
both have, by some accident, descended to our
times, although we cannot pretend to explain
how one of them is preserved in only one manu·
script, and that manuscript written ahout the
end os the twelsth century.
