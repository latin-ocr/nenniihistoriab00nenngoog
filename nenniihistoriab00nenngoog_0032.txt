scribor had fallen are corrected by other copies
of nearly the same antiquity, and of equal pu·
rity3 while the Various Readings gained from the
collation of numerous manuscripts of different
ages have been introduced at the bottom of the
page. The following manuscripts have been
examined for the purpose.¹

A. The H arleian MS. 3859, (fol. 135, b,) a Mayurffirts
manuscript of the tenth century, in small folio, ⁰³¹⁹ οἳ ’
upon vellum, the most important of all the
copies which have been consulted for the pre·
sent edition, and therefore adopted as the basis
of its text. At the bottom of the first page
isa defaced coat of arms, and words which
appear to be, ‘Conventus Mont-Albanensis,'
hut the whole is too far injured by time to be
distinctly seen. Is this reading be correct, it
may be conjectured that the present volume
once formed a portion of the library of the
monastery of Montauban in Quercy, not far
distant from Toulouse. A note, in the hand-
writing of Casley‚ states that it was added to
the Harleian Library on 5th J anuary 17293
beyond which fact nothing is known of its
previous history.

The ‘Historia Britonum' commences on the
reverse of a leaf, the former page of which is
blank; and is without title, rubric, or colophon.

At the top os the first page a more modern, -
hut still ancient hand, has prefixed a title,
‘which has unfortunately suffered in the re-
binding of the manuscript. This title appears

to have been ‘ Incipit Computus!

¹ These manuscripts are cited letters prefixed to the description
in the present edition by the of each.
